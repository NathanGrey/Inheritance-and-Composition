# Inheritance-and-Composition
Assignment 11.1: The Library
Description
In this assignment, you will be creating a virtual library. You'll need to apply the core principles of object-oriented programming to design the class hierarchy of the library. This means applying inheritance and composition where appropriate.

Implement a console library program. Your library will be comprised of documents of the following types:

Books
Magazines
Newspapers
E-books
Each document has the following properties:

Library ID code

The user should be able to interact with the library in the following manner:

List all documents by type (all books, all magazines, etc.)
Find information on a specific book
List all documents by author
Exit the library application
Requirements
Implement the library types using inheritance and composition.
Use inheritance to optimize code reuse.
Use composition to optimize code reuse.
Provide user interface which supports the desired user interaction.
Purpose
Apply core principles of object-oriented programming.

Tools
A PC computer or laptop
Microsoft Windows
Visual Studio Community Edition
